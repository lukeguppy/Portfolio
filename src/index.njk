        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="fade-in-1">I'm Luke, a <strong>Graduate Software Engineer</strong> at Leonardo Helicopters, working on prototypes of <strong>autonomous control systems</strong> using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>. I have experience with machine learning, system design, and software engineering, and enjoy building systems and delivering meaningful, tangible results.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-2">I hold a <strong>1st-Class Honours degree in Computer Science</strong> from the University of Warwick. My 1st-Class dissertation involved using a curriculum learning approach to train a PPO neural network agent for autonomous driving in a custom Unity simulation—giving me deep, hands-on experience in neural networks and system design.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-3">Through professional and personal projects, I have experience with <strong>Python, C++, C#, Java, C, and more languages</strong>. I thrive on taking on new challenges, expanding my skillset, contributing to projects that create a meaningful impact, and I am always looking for the next opportunity to grow.</p>
