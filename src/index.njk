    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Luke, a Graduate Software Engineer at Leonardo Helicopters, working in Python and C++ on autonomous control systems. I enjoy solving challenging problems and building software that gives rewarding tangible results.</p>
    
    <p>I hold a 1st-Class Honours degree in Computer Science from the University of Warwick. My 1st-Class dissertation focused on training a curriculum learning approach to teach a PPO neural network to drive a car in a custom Unity traffic simulation. This gave me hands-on experience in machine learning, problem-solving, and system design.</p>
    
    <p>Through work experience, university projects, and personal projects, I've gained expertise in software engineering, machine learning, and system design, with a strong focus on problem-solving and adaptability. I have used a variety of languages including but not limited to python, C++, C#, java, C, haskell... I am looking for opportunities to grow, take on new challenges, and contribute to projects that expand my skills and impact.</p>
