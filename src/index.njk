        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="fade-in-1">I'm Luke, a **Graduate Software Engineer** at Leonardo Helicopters, focused on solving challenging problems in **autonomous control systems** using **Python** and **C++**. I specialize in **machine learning, system design, and software engineering**, consistently building tools that deliver measurable, tangible results.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-2">I hold a **1st-Class Honours degree in Computer Science** from the University of Warwick. My 1st-Class dissertation involved using a curriculum learning approach to train a PPO neural network agent for autonomous driving in a custom Unity simulation—giving me deep, hands-on experience in neural networks and system design.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-3">Through professional and personal projects, I have experience with **Python, C++, C#, Java, C, and more languages**. I thrive on taking on new challenges, expanding my skillset, contributing to projects that create a meaningful impact, and I am always looking for the next opportunity to grow.</p>
